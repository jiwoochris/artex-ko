# BODA host triage — a read-only responder helper for a suspected BODA host.
#
# The rest of detections/ serves defenders who run a SIEM (Sigma), a network
# sensor (Suricata), or a threat-intel platform (the MISP / CSV indicators). This
# script serves the other responder: the one standing at a single suspect host's
# shell, with no SIEM, who needs to answer "did BODA run here?" from local state.
# It operationalizes the same indicators the rest of the directory ships, plus the
# three host/DB indicators the indicator list deliberately carries WITHOUT a Sigma
# rule because they are not log- or network-observable and can only be checked on
# the box itself (see detections/indicators/boda_indicators.csv — the rows whose
# `rule` column is empty: server-listen-port, recording-proxy-endpoint,
# postgres-exploration-schema).
#
# It is a TRIAGE LEAD generator, not an alerting rule. Every check is grounded in
# a string or path verified in this repository's source, and every finding carries
# the same honest caveat the matching Sigma rule or indicator row carries: ports
# are configurable, the MITM CA filename is shared with standalone mitmproxy, the
# guard marker also appears in logs that merely quote this guide. A hit is a reason
# to look closer, never an attribution on its own, and the absence of every finding
# is NOT a clean bill of health — an operator can rename the binary, move the data
# directory, or change the ports.
#
# What it checks (each cites the source it is grounded in):
#   1. Listening ports        :8787 (admin UI) and 127.0.0.1:8788 (recording proxy)
#                             — defaults of the --addr / --proxy flags in
#                               cmd/boda/main.go. Parsed from `ss`/`netstat`/`lsof`
#                               on the live host, or from --ports-from FILE.
#   2. Recording-proxy MITM    <data-dir>/traffic/_ca/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem and the
#      CA + stores             sibling _index/index.sqlite and _blobs/ the recorder
#                             writes on first start (traffic/traffic.go; the data
#                               dir default is data/ next to the binary — see
#                               cmd/boda/main.go). The CA is the trust anchor of an
#                               adversary-in-the-middle traffic recorder (ATT&CK
#                               T1557).
#   3. Log markers            the enrichment prober UA `boda-enrich/1.0`
#                               (enrich/enrich.go), the self-update egress UA
#                               `boda-selfupdate` (selfupdate/github.go), and the
#                               platform-guard audit marker (guard/guard.go) in the
#                               log file(s) you point it at. Rotated logs that
#                               logrotate compressed as .gz/.bz2/.xz are read
#                               through their standard-library codec so their
#                               history is scanned too; a format with no stdlib
#                               codec (.zst/.lz4) is reported as skipped, never
#                               silently treated as clean.
#   4. PostgreSQL schema      the dual-graph exploration tables (exploration_nodes /
#                               _edges / _anchors with assets / companies / activity
#                               and the agent_prompts seed) in the BODA store
#                               (db/schema.sql). Run against a DSN with `psql` if
#                               available; otherwise the script prints the exact
#                               read-only query for you to run by hand.
#   5. Process env injection  a running process whose environment carries the
#                               recording proxy (HTTP_PROXY / HTTPS_PROXY / ALL_PROXY)
#                               together with a toolchain CA-trust var (SSL_CERT_FILE /
#                               CURL_CA_BUNDLE / REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE / GIT_SSL_CAINFO /
#                               NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS) pointing at a mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem.
#                               BODA injects exactly these into every worker tool it
#                               spawns (agent/worker.go proxyEnv, asserted by
#                               agent/proxyenv_test.go). The variable NAMES are
#                               hard-coded in the source, so this tell survives an
#                               operator renaming the binary or changing the ports —
#                               a stronger signal than the bare listen port. Read from
#                               /proc on the live Linux host, or from --proc-from FILE.
#
# Safety: pure Python standard library, no network, no writes anywhere except the
# self-test's own temporary directory. It reads host state (open ports, a data
# directory, log files, the environments of running processes via /proc, and — only
# if you pass a DSN — the database) and prints what it found. Use it only on a host
# you own or are authorized in writing to inspect.
#
# Usage:
#   detections/triage/boda_host_triage.py --data-dir /opt/boda/data \
#       --log /var/log/syslog --log-dir /var/log/boda
#   detections/triage/boda_host_triage.py --pg-dsn "$BODA_PG_DSN"
#   detections/triage/boda_host_triage.py --proc-from proc_env_dump.txt  # offline
#   detections/triage/boda_host_triage.py --self-test     # reproducible fixture test
#   detections/triage/boda_host_triage.py --json          # machine-readable findings
#
# Exit code: 0 by default (triage, not a gate). With --exit-code, exits 1 if any
# finding fired. --self-test exits non-zero on any self-test failure.
