# Runs every detection test suite under this directory in one command — the
# local-developer and pre-commit counterpart to the per-suite CI steps in
# ../../.github/workflows/detections.yml. CONTRIBUTING.md and this directory's
# README.md promise that each suite "drops straight into CI or a pre-commit
# hook"; this is the single entry point that honours that promise for all of
# them at once, so a contributor does not have to invoke the eight run.sh scripts
# by hand (and reviewers do not have to improvise a loop).
#
# It runs the suites in the same order as CI, lets each suite's own output flow
# through, prints a one-line PASS/FAIL summary per suite at the end, and exits
# non-zero if any suite failed — so it is safe to drop into a CI step or a
# pre-commit hook. Every suite runs to completion even if an earlier one fails,
# so one invocation surfaces every regression rather than only the first.
#
# No host dependency beyond Docker: each suite runs its checks in a container and
# writes nothing to the repo tree (see the per-suite run.sh headers). The image
# and version overrides the child scripts honour (PYTHON_IMAGE, SIGMA_CLI_VERSION,
# SIGMAHQ_VALIDATORS_VERSION, SURICATA_IMAGE) are inherited from this process's
# environment, so exporting any of them here applies to every suite at once.

# silently breaks the "run-all.sh runs the same suites as CI" promise, which no
