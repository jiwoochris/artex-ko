# In-container half of the BODA Sigma SigmaHQ-convention lint test. run.sh
# launches this inside a Python container with the Sigma rule tree mounted
# read-only at /sigma and this directory at /src. It installs a pinned sigma-cli
# plus the pinned SigmaHQ validator plugin, then asserts two properties:
#
#   1. baseline is clean    sigma check with the documented validators.yml
#                           baseline reports 0 errors and 0 issues.
#   2. the full set is live  running ALL SigmaHQ validators (no exclusions) still
#                           reports issues, and every issue type is one of the
#                           four documented, excluded categories — nothing else.
#
# Property 2 is the anti-vacuity guard. If the validator plugin failed to load,
# the "all" run would report zero issues and property 1 would pass vacuously;
# requiring the known exclusions to appear proves the full SigmaHQ set actually
# ran. It also fails the build the moment a rule picks up a NEW convention issue
# outside the documented baseline (e.g. a mis-cased title or an invalid field),
# because that issue type would not be in the allow-list below and property 1
# would stop being clean.
#
# POSIX sh (the slim image ships dash). Exits non-zero if any assertion fails.
