# In-container half of the BODA Sigma rule test. run.sh launches this inside a
# Python container with the Sigma rule tree mounted read-only at /sigma. It
# installs a pinned sigma-cli (pySigma) plus the splunk backend, then asserts
# the properties the rule files and the defense guide claim:
#
#   1. structural + best-practice validation passes          (sigma check == 0 errors)
#   2. the whole tree compiles to a backend query language   (sigma convert -> splunk)
#   3. each atomic indicator string survives into the query  (enrich UA, self-update UA, guard marker, CA file)
#   4. the correlation rules compile as correlations         (event_count / value_count aggregations)
#   5. a correlation rule converted ALONE fails              (it genuinely depends on its atomic base rule)
#
# POSIX sh (the slim image ships dash). Exits non-zero if any assertion fails.
