# In-container half of the BODA ATT&CK coverage-layer test. run.sh launches this
# inside a Python container with the detections tree mounted read-only at
# /detections. It proves that the ATT&CK Navigator layer in
# detections/attack/boda_navigator_layer.json stays consistent with the rules it
# claims to cover, so the layer cannot silently drift from the Sigma rule set:
#
#   1. the layer is valid JSON with the required Navigator v4.x fields
#   2. every technique entry has a well-formed ID and a valid ATT&CK tactic
#   3. the scored techniques are EXACTLY the attack.* techniques tagged on the
#      rules (bidirectional: no rule technique missing from the layer, no layer
#      technique absent from the rules)
#   4. the scored tactics are exactly the attack.* tactics tagged on the rules
#   5. every scored technique's comment grounds it in a rule file that exists
#   6. any score-less entry is a display-only parent of a scored sub-technique
#   7. scores stay within the gradient bounds
#
# Pure standard library (the slim image already ships python3); nothing is
# installed and nothing is written to the repo. Exits non-zero on any failure.
