# Live event-matching test for the BODA Sigma rules (../../sigma/). check.sh
# installs a pinned pySigma inside a container and runs this script with the rule
# tree mounted read-only at /sigma and this directory at /src.
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHY IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE sigma/ SUITE
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# The sigma/ suite proves each rule is structurally valid and COMPILES to a
# backend query, and that its indicator strings survive into that query. It does
# NOT prove the rule actually fires on a matching event, or stays quiet on a
# benign one: a field renamed to something the log never carries, a wildcard that
# silently dropped, or an over-broad token would all still compile cleanly. The
# README's own principle is that "a detection you cannot run is only a claim," and
# the Suricata suite already backs its network rule with a real pcap replay
# (fires on the probe UA, silent on a benign browser). This suite closes the same
# gap for the host/log-layer Sigma rules on two levels:
#   - ATOMIC rules (../../sigma/*.yml): for each rule a representative malicious
#     event MATCHES and a benign event DOES NOT.
#   - CORRELATION rules (../../sigma/correlation/*.yml): for each rule a positive
#     timeline (threshold met, inside the window, within one group) FIRES and
#     negative timelines (below threshold, threshold met but spread beyond the
#     window, split across groups, or missing a leg) stay QUIET.
#
# HOW IT MATCHES (trust model)
# ----------------------------
# It does not hand-parse the YAML or re-implement Sigma's modifier logic. pySigma
# parses each rule and compiles its modifiers and condition into a tree:
# `|contains` becomes a wildcard-wrapped value, `|all` becomes an AND over values,
# `1 of selection_*` becomes an OR over the selection groups. This script only
# walks that compiled tree (AND / OR / NOT / field-equals / keyword) and tests
# each leaf against the event, so the authoritative parsing stays in pySigma. A
# leaf value or condition node this script does not explicitly support raises
# rather than passing silently (fail-closed), so a future rule using an
# unsupported construct surfaces loudly here instead of being waved through.
#
# For a correlation rule, pySigma likewise parses the aggregation spec — type
# (event_count / value_count / temporal), group-by fields, timespan, the
# threshold condition, and the resolved references to the atomic base rules. This
# script walks that parsed spec and applies it to a timeline, deciding which
# events feed each referenced rule with the very same atomic matcher above, so the
# Sigma logic again stays in pySigma; only the windowed aggregation is applied
# here. The correlation rules reference their atomics by id, so each is parsed in a
# collection that also holds every atomic rule (pySigma resolves the reference).
#
# SCOPE AND HONESTY (read before trusting a green run)
# ----------------------------------------------------
#  - The CORRELATION window is the standard sliding-window interpretation: a
#    window of `timespan` seconds anchored at each matching event, with inclusive
#    bounds. Each timeline event carries an integer `ts` in relative seconds. A
#    real SIEM's windowing (tumbling vs sliding, bound inclusivity, late arrival)
#    may differ; this is a regression test for the rule's group-by / timespan /
#    threshold logic — that it fires when they are satisfied and not when they are
#    not — rather than a bit-exact model of any one backend's correlation engine.
#  - Matching is CASE-INSENSITIVE. This mirrors the default of the splunk backend
#    the sigma/ suite targets, and the destructive rule's own false-positive note
#    assumes it (it warns that lowercase coreutils `truncate` shares the uppercase
#    `TRUNCATE ` token and must be allow-listed). Your SIEM's case handling and
#    field normalisation may differ; this is a regression test for the rules'
#    field/value/condition logic, not a substitute for validating in your stack.
#  - Keyword matching (the audit-framing rule) is modelled as a full-text
#    substring search across all event field values, the common interpretation of
#    an unbound Sigma keyword.
#
# Exits non-zero on any failure. Standard library only beyond pySigma.
