# Reproducible live event-matching test for the BODA Sigma rules — both the
# atomic rules (../../sigma/*.yml) and the correlation rules
# (../../sigma/correlation/*.yml). The sibling sigma/ suite proves those rules are
# valid and COMPILE to a backend query; this suite proves they actually FIRE on a
# matching event (or timeline) and stay quiet on a benign one — the same "a
# detection you cannot run is only a claim" guarantee the suricata/ suite already
# gives the network rule with a pcap replay.
#
# It proves six properties with no host dependency beyond Docker (pySigma runs in
# a container, nothing is installed on the host and nothing is written to the repo
# tree):
#
#   atomic 1  rule/sample pairing   every atomic rule has an events/<name>.json and
#                                   every events file maps to a rule (no orphans)
#   atomic 2  true positives        each rule matches all of its malicious events
#   atomic 3  true negatives        each rule matches none of its benign events
#   corr   1  rule/timeline pairing every correlation rule has an
#                                   events/correlation/<name>.json (no orphans)
#   corr   2  true positives        each rule FIRES on its positive timeline
#                                   (threshold met, inside the window, one group)
#   corr   3  true negatives        each rule stays QUIET on its negative timelines
#                                   (below threshold, window exceeded, split group,
#                                   or a missing leg)
#
# pySigma parses each rule — for an atomic rule its condition tree, for a
# correlation rule its aggregation spec (type, group-by, timespan, threshold, and
# the resolved references to the atomic base rules) — and check.py only walks that
# parsed structure, so the authoritative Sigma logic stays in pySigma (see
# check.py's header). The correlation window is the standard sliding-window model
# and matching is case-insensitive; see check.py for the full scope and honesty
# notes.
