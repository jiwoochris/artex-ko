# Harness self-consistency check for the detection test suites. check-harness-sync.sh
# launches this inside a Python container with the detection tree and the CI
# workflow mounted read-only under /repo. It proves the one thing the eight
# detection suites cannot: that run-all.sh, the CI workflow, and the suite
# directories on disk all name the same suites in the same order.
#
# run-all.sh, CONTRIBUTING, and this directory's README all promise that
# "run-all.sh runs the same suites as CI, in the same order." Nothing enforced
# that promise. A suite added to only one of the three places — a new CI step with
# no SUITES entry, or a new directory never wired into either — passes every
# per-suite test while quietly breaking the promise: run-all.sh and CI run
# different sets, so a green run-all.sh locally no longer implies a green CI. This
# check closes that gap the same way the indicator test closes the
# CI-paths / pre-commit-regex gap: it reads the three sources of truth and asserts
# they agree.
#
#   A = the SUITES="..." list in run-all.sh                       (ordered)
#   B = the per-suite `run: detections/tests/<x>/run.sh` steps     (ordered)
#       in .github/workflows/detections.yml
#   C = the subdirectories of detections/tests/ that carry a       (a set)
#       run.sh
#
# It asserts A == B as ordered lists (so the documented "same order as CI" holds)
# and set(A) == C (so no directory is orphaned and no listed suite is missing on
# disk). It is deliberately not a detection suite: it is not in SUITES, not a
# `.../run.sh` CI step, and not a run.sh directory, so it never counts itself and
# the eight detection suites stay eight.
#
# It parses only the stable machine-readable lines (the SUITES assignment, the
# `run:` steps, the directory listing), never prose or the example-output blocks
# in the READMEs, so it cannot go brittle on documentation wording.
#
# Pure standard library (the slim image already ships python3); nothing is
# installed and nothing is written to the repo. Exits non-zero on any mismatch.
#
# Usage. check-harness-sync.sh runs this inside Docker with the repo mounted at
# /repo, which is why ROOT defaults to /repo below. To run it directly on the
# host instead, point BODA_REPO_ROOT at the repo root:
#
#     BODA_REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" \
#         python3 detections/tests/check-harness-sync.py
