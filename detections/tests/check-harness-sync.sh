# Harness self-consistency check for the detection test suites (see
# check-harness-sync.py for the assertions). It proves the one thing the eight
# detection suites cannot: that run-all.sh, the CI workflow, and the suite
# directories on disk all name the same suites in the same order, so a suite
# wired into only one of the three cannot silently break the "run-all.sh runs the
# same suites as CI" promise while every per-suite test stays green.
#
# It is a gate, not a suite: run-all.sh runs it before the suite loop and it does
# not appear in the per-suite summary, and it is not itself a SUITES entry, a
# `.../run.sh` CI step, or a run.sh directory — so the eight detection suites stay
# eight and this check never counts itself.
#
# No host dependency beyond Docker: the check is pure Python standard library and
# runs in a container with only the detection tree and the CI workflow mounted
# read-only (never work/ or anything else). Nothing is installed on the host and
# nothing is written to the repo.
#
# Usage:   detections/tests/check-harness-sync.sh
# Env:     PYTHON_IMAGE  (default python:3.12-slim)
