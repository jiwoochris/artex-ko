# Source-of-truth consistency test for the BODA detection indicators
# (see check.py for the assertions). It proves the one thing the Sigma, Suricata,
# and ATT&CK tests do not: that each rule's pinned indicator is still the string
# BODA's own source actually emits. The realistic rot it catches is an upstream
# re-sync that bumps the prober User-Agent or rewrites the guard marker — every
# other test stays green while the deployed rule silently stops matching.
#
# No host dependency beyond Docker: the check is pure Python standard library and
# runs in a container with only the rule tree, the published indicator list, the
# source packages it pins, and the two configs that gate on them — the CI workflow
# and the pre-commit hook — mounted read-only (never work/ or anything else).
# Nothing is installed on the host and nothing is written to the repo.
#
# Usage:   detections/tests/indicators/run.sh
# Env:     PYTHON_IMAGE  (default python:3.12-slim)
