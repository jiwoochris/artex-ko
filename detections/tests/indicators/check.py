# Source-of-truth consistency test for the BODA detection indicators. run.sh
# launches this inside a Python container with the detection rules and the
# upstream source packages they pin mounted read-only under /repo. It proves one
# property the other three detection tests do not: that each rule's pinned
# indicator is still the string BODA's own source actually emits.
#
# The Sigma test proves an indicator survives rule->query *compilation*; the
# ATT&CK test proves the layer matches the rules' tags; the Suricata test proves
# the network rule *fires*. None of them look back at the source the indicator
# claims to come from. So the realistic rot they miss is an upstream re-sync that
# bumps the prober User-Agent to "boda-enrich/2.0" or rewrites the guard marker:
# every rule still compiles, the layer still matches, the pcap test still fires on
# the synthesized capture — and the deployed rule silently stops matching real
# BODA traffic. This test turns detections/README's claim ("every indicator is
# grounded in a string verified in this repository's source, not inferred") and
# CONTRIBUTING's first contribution contract into a guard a reviewer can re-run.
#
# For every indicator it asserts, bidirectionally:
#   - source drift: the value is still present in the upstream source file(s)
#     that emit it (fails if an upstream re-sync changed the source but not the
#     rule -> the rule is now stale);
#   - rule drift: the value is still pinned in the rule(s) built on it (fails if a
#     rule edit moved the indicator away from the source).
# The enrichment UA also carries a Suricata prefix check, because that rule
# matches the User-Agent by `startswith` and so pins a prefix of the full value.
#
# The destructive-command tokens are handled separately and honestly: they are
# generic hunting leads, not unique BODA fingerprints, so the test only asserts
# the correspondence the rule actually claims — each token appears both in BODA's
# guard deny-list (db/db.go) and in the hunting rule that mirrors it.
#
# It then validates the published, machine-readable indicator list
# (detections/indicators/boda_indicators.csv): every row's value must still be
# present in the source file(s) it cites and pinned in the rule(s) it cites, and
# every fingerprint this test grounds must appear in the list — so the artifact a
# defender imports cannot silently drift from the source it claims to come from.
#
# Finally it closes the loop on the two gates that fire this test: the CI workflow
# (.github/workflows/detections.yml push/pull_request paths) and the local
# pre-commit hook (.pre-commit-config.yaml files regex). Every upstream source file
# this test reads must be covered by both, or a change touching only a newly pinned
# source (as cmd/boda/main.go once was) would skip the test on one of them: on CI
# the drift sails through the merge gate green, on the hook it is never caught
# locally even though the hook's comment promises "the same source scope as CI".
# The check derives the required set from the indicators it already asserts, so
# pinning a new source without wiring it into *both* gates fails here until they
# stay in sync.
#
# Pure standard library (the slim image already ships python3); nothing is
# installed and nothing is written to the repo. Exits non-zero on any failure.
