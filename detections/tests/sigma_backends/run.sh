# Reproducible backend-portability test for the BODA Sigma rules (../../sigma/).
# The rule README claims the rules "convert to your own SIEM or EDR query
# language" and lists several supported targets. The base Sigma test (../sigma/)
# only exercises Splunk; this test turns the cross-backend claim into something a
# reviewer can re-run, and keeps the README's per-backend guidance honest.
#
# It proves two properties with no host dependency beyond Docker (sigma-cli and
# its backends run in a container, nothing is installed on the host and nothing
# is written to the repo tree):
#
#   1. correlations are portable    the whole tree converts on splunk, the
#                                   Elasticsearch eql target, and Grafana loki
#   2. the atomic-only fallback     the five atomic rules convert on lucene and
#      works                        kusto (Microsoft Sentinel / Defender), which
#                                   do not support Sigma correlation conversion
#
# See ../README.md "Sigma backend portability" for the measured support matrix
# and the exact per-backend commands this test reproduces.

# Usage:   detections/tests/sigma_backends/run.sh
