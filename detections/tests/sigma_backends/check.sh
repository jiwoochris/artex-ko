# In-container half of the BODA Sigma backend-portability test. run.sh launches
# this inside a Python container with the Sigma rule tree mounted read-only at
# /sigma. It installs a pinned sigma-cli (pySigma) plus four stable backends and
# proves that the rules convert beyond the single Splunk example the README used
# to show, and that the documented per-backend guidance is true for OUR rules.
#
# The base Sigma test (../sigma/) proves the rules are correct against Splunk.
# This test proves they are PORTABLE, and pins the two facts the README's
# "Validate and convert" section now documents:
#
#   1. Correlations are portable        the WHOLE tree (atomic + correlation)
#      beyond Splunk                    converts on splunk, Elasticsearch eql,
#                                        and Grafana loki (exit 0), and the enrich
#                                        indicator value survives into each query.
#   2. The atomic-only fallback works   backends that do not support Sigma
#      where correlations are not        correlation conversion (Elasticsearch
#      supported                         lucene, Microsoft kusto) still convert
#                                        the five atomic rules (exit 0), with the
#                                        enrich indicator surviving.
#
# Every assertion is POSITIVE (a capability that must keep working), so the test
# only fails on a genuine regression: a rule that stops converting, or a backend
# that drops support. It deliberately does not assert the negative "backend X
# cannot do correlations" — that would break when a backend improves. The honest
# limitation is documented in ../README.md, reproduced by this test's commands.
#
# POSIX sh (the slim image ships dash). Exits non-zero if any assertion fails.
